# wasteagram

A simple Flutter project exploring use of platform hardware services, remote storage services, form data, and accessibility features.

The goal of the app is to give users, in this case restaurant owners, a way to track food waste. They simply take a photo of any food waste and fill out a form for quantity and description. This data, and their geographic location, are added to a google firestore database, and displayed in a list view for all users of the app.
